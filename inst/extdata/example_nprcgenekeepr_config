# The formatting in this example file is intentionally sloppy to illustrate
# the essential features and to point out what has no effect.
# Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# It is critical to have the term being defined immediately before an equals
# symbol "=". The defining term(s) are to follow the equals symbol.
# Multiple defining terms can be separated with one or more blank characters,
# commas, semicolons, or newline characters. Parentheses may be used for
# readability, but they are ignored.
#
# In many cases the defining term will need to be in quotes because they will
# have characters that would serve to break up the definition into multiple
# tokens. For example http://deepthought:8080/labkey would become a meaningless
# collection of four terms: http, deepthought, 8080, and labkey.
#
# center is a term used to tell the application which features are to be
# available and to allow custom branding with image files.
#
# The rest of the terms are used by the Rlabkey package and the labkey-api-r.
# lkPedColumns are the names of the columns used by the LabKey instance
# being queried.
# mapPedColumns are a one to one mapping of the lkPedColumns to the column
# names used by the nprcgenekeepr package.

# To use this file or one similar, it must be renamed to "_nprcgenekeepr_config"
# for users of Microsoft Windows operating systems and ".nprcgenekeepr_config"
# for other operating systems.
# It must be edited so that the various terms are appropriately defined.
# The file is to be place in the user's home directory.

# This file is dependent on the user having an appropriately configure
# "_netrc" (Windows) or ".netrc" (non-Windows) file as described at
# https://www.labkey.org/Documentation/wiki-page.view?name=netrc
